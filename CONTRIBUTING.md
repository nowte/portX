# Contributing to This Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project ‚Äî your help is greatly appreciated!

This document provides guidelines to help make the contribution process smooth, structured, and productive for everyone involved.

---

## üìå Before You Start

- **Familiarize yourself with the project**: Understand how the `console.bat`, Python scripts, and command system work.
- **Check for existing issues or feature requests** before submitting a new one.
- Make sure your environment includes Python 3.7+ and the required dependencies (`colorama`, etc.).

## üß© How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the GitHub page to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-fork.git
cd your-fork
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch
Always work on a new branch rather than the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Follow the existing coding style. All new command modules should:

- Define `__command__` and `__description__` at the top of the file
- Use the utils.log() function for logging
- Be compatible with both Windows and Unix systems if possible

### 5. Test Your Changes
- Test locally before pushing. Ensure that:
- The command runs correctly using `console.bat`
- No existing functionality is broken
- `build_command_index.py` successfully indexes the command

### 6. Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: new command [your-feature-name]"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request
- Go to your fork on GitHub and click New Pull Request. Clearly describe:
- What you changed
- Why the change is needed
- Any known issues or limitations

### üß™ Code Style & Guidelines
- Use Python 3.7+
- Follow PEP 8 where applicable
- Keep code clean, modular, and commented
- Use `argparse` for command-line arguments
- Use `utils.log()` for standardized output with log levels
